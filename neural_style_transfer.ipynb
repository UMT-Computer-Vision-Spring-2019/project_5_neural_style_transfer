    "## What do CNNs see?\n",
    "We have used neural networks primarily for the purposes of object recognition and image segmentation, as these are perhaps their most common uses.  However, the conceptual simplicity of the problem statement belie the complexity of the models under the hood.  In particular, we can ask: why are (convolutional) neural networks so good at these tasks that we have set out for them?  What are they doing that is so different from previous techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, neural networks work for abstract cases that would lead to failure for simpler methods.  Take \"Where's Waldo\" as an example.  As we saw, template matching was extremely sensitive to the quality of the template, and when Waldo appeared in a slightly different orientation, the algorithm failed abjectly.  CNNs on the other hand can recognize objects in a variety of poses, scales, etc. without difficulty.  They do this by creating a transformation of the input data (the image) that is relatively invariant to these changes, and that operates hierarchically.  For example, the first kernel(s) of a network tends to search for simple features: lines at various orientations, blobs, particular colors, and so on.  These features are in turn convolved with another set of kernels that activate on a more complex input with a larger receptive field: lines and colors become simple shapes.  At the next layer, simple shapes become something more complex: textures or anatomical features such as eyes.  Moving further up the network, eyes become pairs of eyes, pairs of eyes become faces, and faces pair with other features to become, say, a dog.  Each of these representations has some flexibility, and this flexibility when coupled with the progressively generated representation of an object of interest is what yields the capacity for convolutional neural networks to tackle objects with the capacity for abstraction similar to the human visual system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this hierarchy of features is generated programatically, *we have access to every level as the network builds up its representation of an object*.  We've been interested in the final product as the input to softmax classifier, but here we will explore the internal representation of objects in neural networks through a remarkable application known as *neural style transfer*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Style transfer\n",
    "Style transfer is the process of creating a new image that has the style of one image (which we will call the *style image*) and the content of another (the *content image*).  Here's an example of style transfer (by a person, not a network)\n",
    "<img src=chicken.jpg width=400/> \n",
    "We have a content image (the KFC logo) and a style image (the Obama Hope poster by Shephard Fairey).  Here, the literal content of the KFC logo is reproduced, but with the semantic content of the poster. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Neural style transfer\n",
    "Neural style transfer is the procedure of performing style transfer automatically with the help of neural networks.  While a few mechanisms have been proposed to solve this problem, we will utilize the [original approach](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).  For our example, let's use the following content and style images:"

While it would certainly be possible to ask the algorithm to match the content image exactly, this isn't exactly what we want: rather, we want the features to match roughly, in an abstract way.  For example, if a door shows up in the content image, we want a door to show up in the style image, but it doesn't have to be exactly straight up and down, nor does it have to have the same color.  It just needs to be door-like in a general sense.  To do this, instead of asking the algorithm to minimize the difference between the combined image and the door, we can minimize the difference of feature maps computed at some layer of a convolutional neural network between the combined and content images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course we must select a neural network to use in order to make these feature representations.  In almost all instances of neural style transfer, the VGG19 network is used.  VGG19 is a fairly old network and far from the state of the art for tasks such as object recognition.  However, it almost unanimously provides the best results for neural style transfer, most likely because of its simplicity: there aren't any skip connections or other strange architectural styles, and the resulting features are thus closer to the ideal description of a neural network given above.  Packaged along with this notebook is a Keras implementation of VGG19, that also loads a set of weights pretrained on the [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/) dataset.  You can download the requisite weights [here](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/#downloading-the-pre-trained-models).  (Note actually that the VGG19 provided by me is *not* the original VGG19, nor is it equivalent to the pre-trained model that is packaged with Keras: max-pooling has been replaced with average pooling, the activations have been broken out into explicit layers, and the weights are oriented such that it operates on mean-subtracted RGB images, rather than BGR.  These modifications provide better neural style transfer results.)\n",

    "A few gotchas: 1. the scipy algorithm expects a vector, while our method expects an array of size (1,height,width,3).  You'll need to do some reshaping of input and output arrays and puts the arguments to both the tensorflow function and to the scipy optimizer in the formats that they expect.  2. We have to compute the loss to compute the gradient, but the gradient of the loss doesn't change unless the loss is recomputed.  Thus, the functions that go into fmin_l_bfgs_b should be aware of that fact, and should avoid unnecessary computation.  Both (1) and (2) above can be addressed by generating a python class that have both a loss and gradient method that perform the necessary array reshapings internally, and that don't recompute the gradient once it's already been computed (stated concretely, the loss method should call \"loss_and_grad_evaluator\", and should return the loss while saving the gradient.  The gradient method should simply return this precomputed gradient.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, when you output the result of your optimization, you'll want to re-add the band means we extracted earlier (R=103.939, G=116.779, B=123.68), cast the array back to integer, and clip any values greater than 255 before saving.  "
